### To note:
- The profile page returns an object with the data of my work, to mimic fetching an API. The images are hosted on a client's site with their permission (don't stress!)


### Personal Views:
Making this was very fun. It turned from a personal project into my profile page, which is why there is some redundant code still floating around. I plan on making some fun stuff with figma, on top of what I have already put in with the little motorcycle animation (riding and camping is a personal hobby).
